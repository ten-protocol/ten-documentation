# Ten Bridge

## Overview

The Ten Bridge project aims to facilitate the seamless transfer of assets between the Ethereum blockchain and the Ten blockchain. This documentation provides an overview of the project, its purpose, supported tokens, and usage instructions.

## Purpose

The primary goal of the Ten Bridge is to enable users to move assets between Ethereum and Ten efficiently and securely. This bridge will serve as a vital infrastructure component for users who wish to interact with assets on both blockchains.

## Supported Tokens

To provide flexibility and utility to users, the Ten Bridge supports the following tokens:
- Ethereum (ETH)
- TEN token (TEN)
- Tether (USDT)
- USD Coin (USDC)

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before using the Ten Bridge, ensure you have the following:
- MetaMask or any Ethereum-compatible wallet

### Steps to Transfer Assets

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the Ten Bridge interface.
2. Select the asset you wish to transfer and specify the destination blockchain (Ethereum or TEN).
3. Enter the amount of the asset you want to transfer.
4. Review the transaction details and confirm the transfer.
5. Once confirmed, wait for the transaction to be processed. The transfer may take some time depending on network congestion.
6. Once the transfer is complete, you will receive a confirmation notification.

### Notes

- Please ensure you have sufficient gas fees (for Ethereum transactions) and Ten network fees to cover the transaction costs.
- Transactions may take varying amounts of time to process depending on network congestion and other factors.
- Always double-check the recipient address before confirming the transfer to avoid any potential loss of assets.
