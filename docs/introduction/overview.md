Ten is revolutionizing Ethereum with encrypted layer 2 solution. Just as HTTPS transformed Web 2.0, ushering in a new era of secure applications and enhanced user trust, Ten is set to redefine the Ethereum ecosystem. By introducing an encrypted Ethereum Layer 2, Ten not only amplifies transaction speed and efficiency but also fortifies it with the robust security and consensus mechanisms inherent to Ethereum.

Serving as a cutting-edge Layer 2 blockchain solution, Ten significantly reduces transaction costs while seamlessly inheriting Ethereum's unparalleled security features. What sets Ten apart is its commitment to privacy and encryption. Every transaction input, the intricate state of smart contracts, and the entire execution process remain encrypted, ensuring utmost confidentiality. This encryption in blockchain ensures users and developers enjoy a familiar Web2 experience without compromising on privacy or functionality.

With Ten, the possibilities for Web3 applications are boundless. From next-gen gaming platforms and advanced DeFi 2.0 systems to dark pool trading, sealed-bid auctions, confidential agreements, secure identity management, and beyond, Ten is at the forefront of a private and efficient decentralized future.


How is Ten different from other L2s?

We’re different in a few ways. Ten is a general-purpose L2 on Ethereum. Think Optimistic-based L2s; these allow you to redeploy/deploy existing/new Ethereum Dapps, save massively on gas and transact a lot faster, except they come with long withdrawal times and are generally centralized.
ZK-Rollups, the other type of L2 offers similar advantages; they have no withdrawal delay, however, they are not general-purpose. Currently, all rollup solutions are centralized. We designed Ten to sit in the sweet spot between Optimistic and ZK rollups. In addition, with Ten, out of the box, you’ll be part of a completely decentralized encrypted network, have data confidentially (hidden balances, transacting, etc.), and MEV prevention baked in.

How is Ten different from other L1 networks?

Rather than build an entirely new L1 network, Ten is an L2 built on Ethereum, so we leverage the security, adoption, and liquidity of Ethereum. This allows developers to build encrypted applications while leveraging existing Ethereum smart contracts and existing developer tooling.
