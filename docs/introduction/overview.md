# Overview

**TEN Protocol** is a next-generation, Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 rollup that brings **programmable privacy**, **AI-native design**, and **shared encrypted state** to smart contracts. By combining **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** with encrypted EVM transactions, TEN introduces a new primitive: the **confidential rollup** — enabling developers to build trustless applications with data access controls, private logic, and autonomous agents.

TEN reclaims the critical Web2 feature Web3 left behind: **privacy with permissioning**. This unlocks entire categories of applications previously impossible on-chain — like private messaging, hidden game logic, confidential trading strategies, and collaborative AI agents.

## Core Technology

- **Confidential Rollups**  
  A new rollup architecture that merges the scalability of optimistic rollups with privacy guarantees.

- **Encrypted EVM**  
  Smart contracts execute inside TEEs, shielding logic, inputs, and state from all observers — even node operators.

- **Encrypted Transactions**  
  Wallets encrypt transaction data before submission. Decryption occurs only under programmable rules.

- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**  
  Hardware-isolated enclaves trusted by hyperscalers, banks, and AI leaders — now used to run encrypted smart contracts and agents on-chain.

- **Smart Transparency**  
  Developers control what data is public, private, or time-delayed — supporting selective disclosure and compliance.

## AI-Native Architecture

Every user and dApp can run a personal **autonomous AI agent** inside a TEE:

- Manage assets, execute logic, interact with dApps
- Suggest strategies or transact on behalf of users
- Enable confidential collaboration between institutions

---

## Key Use Cases

- **Private Gaming**  
  Fully on-chain hidden-state games (e.g., poker, fog-of-war) with no off-chain servers. AI agents as players, opponents, or coaches.

- **Confidential DeFi**  
  Dark pools, private DEXs, and liquidation-resistant lending — all with hidden thresholds, encrypted order books, and tamper-proof execution.

- **TEE-Stablecoins**  
  Reserve-backed stablecoins with provable, confidential attestation and on-chain enforcement of issuance/redeemability.

- **Autonomous Agreements**  
  Confidential contracts (SLAs, NDAs, term sheets) enforced by oracles without revealing parties or terms.

- **Agent Marketplaces**  
  Deploy trustless AI agents — financial bots, predictors, or assistants — with protected algorithms and private coordination.

## Developer Experience

- Native Solidity / Hardhat / MetaMask compatibility  
- Session keys for seamless UX  
- Free, in-contract randomness (no oracles)  
- Precise timestamping & async execution  
- Native Ethereum bridge

## Data Revelation

Confidentiality on your terms:

- Programmable disclosure (time-based or conditional)
- Full control over visibility windows
- Optional perpetual privacy via governance
