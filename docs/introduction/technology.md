# Technology 

At the heart of TEN's innovative approach to blockchain encryption lies the pragmatic use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These TEEs are not just about encryption; they ensure unparalleled confidentiality while providing absolute certainty about the code in execution. This technology empowers TEN to deliver a unique blend of smart contracts, decentralization, scalability, and encryption, setting a new benchmark in the blockchain realm.

By integrating encryption directly into the Ethereum Mainnet, TEN harnesses the Mainnet's inherent liveness and availability, ensuring impeccable ledger integrity. But what truly sets TEN apart is its proprietary Proof of Block Inclusion (POBI) protocol. This groundbreaking protocol guarantees that TEN's confidential roll-ups achieve consensus within a decentralized TEN network, ensuring both security and transparency.
