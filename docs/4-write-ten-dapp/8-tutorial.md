# Tutorial
You can follow [this](https://github.com/ten-protocol/hft-tutorial/blob/main/README.md) tutorial on GitHub that demonstrates how TEN’s precise timestamping enables sophisticated financial applications requiring exact timing. The combination of privacy, accurate timestamps, and Ethereum compatibility makes TEN ideal for high frequency trading and other time‑sensitive financial applications.

You can either follow the steps in the `README` to build it from scratch or clone the repo and run the existing code.
