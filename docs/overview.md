# Overview

**TEN Protocol** is a next-generation, Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 rollup that brings **programmable privacy**, **AI-native design**, and **shared encrypted state** to smart contracts. By combining **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** with encrypted EVM transactions, TEN introduces a new primitive: the **confidential rollup** — enabling developers to build trustless applications with data access controls, private logic, and autonomous agents.

TEN reclaims the critical Web2 feature Web3 left behind: **privacy with permissioning**. This unlocks entire categories of applications previously impossible on-chain — like private messaging, hidden game logic, confidential trading strategies, and collaborative AI agents.

## Core Technology[​](#core-technology "Direct link to Core Technology")

* **Confidential Rollups**<br /><!-- -->A new rollup architecture that merges the scalability of optimistic rollups with privacy guarantees.

* **Encrypted EVM**<br /><!-- -->Smart contracts execute inside TEEs, shielding logic, inputs, and state from all observers — even node operators.

* **Encrypted Transactions**<br /><!-- -->Wallets encrypt transaction data before submission. Decryption occurs only under programmable rules.

* **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**<br /><!-- -->Hardware-isolated enclaves trusted by hyperscalers, banks, and AI leaders — now used to run encrypted smart contracts and agents on-chain.

* **Smart Transparency**<br /><!-- -->Developers control what data is public, private, or time-delayed — supporting selective disclosure and compliance.

## Data Revelation[​](#data-revelation "Direct link to Data Revelation")

Confidentiality on your terms:

* Programmable disclosure (time-based or conditional)
* Full control over visibility windows
* Optional perpetual privacy via governance
