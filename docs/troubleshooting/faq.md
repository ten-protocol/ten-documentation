## For Developers 

### How do I access the TEN RPC Endpoint?
You will need to obtain an account-specific, unique RPC link using [TEN Hosted Gateway](/docs/tools-infrastructure/hosted-gateway) and authenticate your account to access the Viewing Key and be able to use the RPC endpoints listed in the [API References](/docs/api-reference/json-rpc-apis).

Keep in mind that you will not be able to query data on accounts that have not been authenticated to a specific Encryption token.

### How can I port my dApp from other networks to TEN? 
You need to follow the following steps:

1. Change the functions of your smart contracts according to the instructions given [here](/docs/getting-started/for-developers/explore-contracts-in-ten).
2. Integrate TEN Gateway into your dApp.
3. Deploy your SCs into TEN using [compatible tools](/docs/tools-infrastructure/compatible-tools) (e.g. Truffle Suite).
4. Invite your users to learn more about encryption!
