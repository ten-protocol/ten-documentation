# About the TEN Network Association

## Introduction and Vision

### Mission Statement
The TEN Network Association, the Association, aims to push forward the growth and development of the open-source TEN Network software protocol, building a lively and engaged community around it.

### Purpose
The Association is a not-for-profit organization based in Switzerland, dedicated to promoting, developing, and supporting the TEN software protocol and its ecosystem.  The Association’s goal is to tackle challenges within the Web3 space through decentralized governance and community-driven projects.

## Governance and Structure

### Legal Framework
The Association operates as a Swiss Association governed by Swiss law. The legal foundation includes the Articles of Association, General Assembly Regulations, Organizational Regulations, and Governance Regulations.

### Organizational Structure
There are a number of bodies within the Association. New bodies can be created over time.
1. **TEN Governance, or DAO**: participants in the TEN ecosystem who submit proposals for the advancement of TEN.
1. **General Assembly**: the top decision-making body made up of all members.
1. **Board**: manages and oversees the Association's operations.
1. **Subcommittees**: created to handle specific tasks and projects, for example, the administration of grant programs.

### Decision-Making Process
Decisions are made through a combination of General Assembly votes and decentralized governance mechanisms using TEN tokens. Each token gives you one vote, and you can delegate your voting rights. You also need to hold the TEN tokens for at least 30 days. This prevents flash loan attacks.
Responsible progress of TEN’s evolution is essential to its long term health and well being. If a proposal is voted in by the DAO but it would be bad for the mission of the TEN Network Association or if a law or regulation would be broken then the Board can step in to assist.

## Projects and Initiatives
### Ongoing Projects
The Association supports a variety of projects aimed at improving TEN and its ecosystem, including software development, community-building, and educational initiatives. The Association also selects specific teams to help develop and enrich the TEN.

### Proposals and Voting
DAO members can submit proposals for new projects or changes to the protocol. Proposals are reviewed and voted on by participants in the TEN ecosystem.
