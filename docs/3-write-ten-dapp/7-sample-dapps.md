# Sample dApps

Below you can view our in-house sample dApps developed to harness the power of TEN. 

## Battleships 

On-chain game heavily inspired by the classic board game Battleships. Players are presented with a grid and select squares to try to sink as many of the ships as possible. Each successful hit or ship sinking is rewarded with a ZEN game token.

## Crash Game

A high-stakes betting game where players wager tokens on a rocket's flight trajectory. The rocket's multiplier increases over time, but crashes at an unpredictable moment. Players must cash out before the crash to win their bet multiplied by the current value, or lose everything if they're too greedy.

## Trickly

An on-chain game where the contract holds a private, incrementing number. Each time a player plays, the number is incremented and returned to them. If the number ends in a zero, the player earns a reward in ZEN tokens. The more trailing zeros the number has, the greater the reward.
