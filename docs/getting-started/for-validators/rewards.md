# Node Rewards

As a node operator, your participation is essential in maintaining a secure, reliable, and high-performance network. In recognition of your contributions, TEN has implemented a comprehensive reward structure to incentivize active and consistent engagement in the network’s testnet phases.

***

## Program Overview[​](#program-overview "Direct link to Program Overview")

TEN is an encrypted Layer 2 network built on Ethereum, designed by the team behind Corda. TEN offers a highly scalable and private environment for Web3 applications,including AI, tokenizing real-world assets (RWA), enabling decentralized financial solutions (DeFi) and on-chain games.

### Objective[​](#objective "Direct link to Objective")

TEN’s incentivized testnet rewards participants—including node operators, developers, and users—who actively contribute to testing and improving the network. Node operators play a vital role in decentralizing TEN and ensuring robust node operations, and they are rewarded for maintaining network health, stability, and performance.

## Node Operator Rewards Structure[​](#node-operator-rewards-structure "Direct link to Node Operator Rewards Structure")

TEN has allocated **22,500,000 TEN** (representing 2.25% of the total token supply) to incentivize contributions across the community, including node operations.

### Rewards Overview[​](#rewards-overview "Direct link to Rewards Overview")

1. **Staking Requirements**: Node operators do not need an initial stake to participate in the testnet (however, a minimum of 50,000 TEN tokens will be required for staking on Mainnet).
2. **ETH-Based Compensation**: Node operators receive rewards paid in **ETH** to help cover hosting costs and encourage active participation.
3. **Delegated Staking Model**: Community members can delegate their TEN tokens to node operators, broadening community involvement and fostering a more decentralized ecosystem.

### Performance-Based Rewards[​](#performance-based-rewards "Direct link to Performance-Based Rewards")

Performance-based rewards are structured to motivate the consistent and high-quality performance of nodes, as follows:

* **Top 10% Performers**: The highest 10% of node operators, ranked by performance and uptime, will earn the top reward bracket. Top performers will receive a reward equivalent to the minimum mainnet staking requirement and will be offered priority access to participate in the mainnet launch.
* **Remaining Participants**: Node operators outside the top 10% but in the top 20% will also receive a reward based on their contributions and performance.

### Participation-Based Rewards[​](#participation-based-rewards "Direct link to Participation-Based Rewards")

Node operators who meet minimum participation requirements but do not rank in the top 20% will still receive a reward. These rewards aim to foster inclusivity and recognize the contributions of all node operators.

## Testnet Phases & Participation[​](#testnet-phases--participation "Direct link to Testnet Phases & Participation")

The incentivized testnet is split into three phases, each lasting approximately **6-8 weeks**, followed by a short intermission between phases. The phases are designed to test and validate different aspects of the network:

1. **Phase 1**: Focus on onboarding developers and user quests aimed at network resilience.
2. **Phase 2**: Dedicated to expanding node operations and enhancing network decentralization.
3. **Phase 3**: Final phase with an emphasis on testing newly deployed dApps and security-focused initiatives.

### Eligibility[​](#eligibility "Direct link to Eligibility")

* **Application**: Node operators can apply via the [Validator Application Form](https://cform.coinlist.co/forms/56274a78-8291-4899-bee1-a68ecbc5b2b8).

* **Selection**: Applications are prioritized based on node management experience and community commitment, with selected participants notified by email.

  \* Jurisdictional Limitations will be applied.

## Additional Information[​](#additional-information "Direct link to Additional Information")

* **Updates and Notifications**: Important updates will be shared via the **TEN Discord testnet channel** and by email for selected participants.
* **Documentation**: Technical documents and guides are available on TEN’s official documentation site, with more added throughout the testnet phases.

### Reward Distribution[​](#reward-distribution "Direct link to Reward Distribution")

All rewards will be distributed after the mainnet launch, following the tokenomics vesting schedule outlined in the official TEN whitepaper.

This Node Rewards program aims to build a community-driven network powered by participants' shared efforts and contributions. By rewarding commitment and performance, TEN is cultivating a stable, high-performance Layer 2 ecosystem that is decentralized, secure, and inclusive.
