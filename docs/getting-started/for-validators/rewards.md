# Node Rewards

As a node operator, your participation is essential in maintaining a secure, reliable, and high-performance network. In recognition of your contributions, TEN has implemented a comprehensive reward structure to incentivize active and consistent engagement in the network’s testnet phases.

---

## Program Overview

TEN is an encrypted Layer 2 network built on Ethereum, designed by the team behind Corda. TEN offers a highly scalable and private environment for Web3 applications,including AI, tokenizing real-world assets (RWA), enabling decentralized financial solutions (DeFi) and on-chain games.

### Objective

TEN’s incentivized testnet rewards participants—including node operators, developers, and users—who actively contribute to testing and improving the network. Node operators play a vital role in decentralizing TEN and ensuring robust node operations, and they are rewarded for maintaining network health, stability, and performance.

## Node Operator Rewards Structure

TEN has allocated **22,500,000 TEN** (representing 2.25% of the total token supply) to incentivize contributions across the community, including node operations.

### Rewards Overview

1. **Staking Requirements**: Node operators do not need an initial stake to participate in the testnet (however, a minimum of 50,000 TEN tokens will be required for staking on Mainnet).
2. **ETH-Based Compensation**: Node operators receive rewards paid in **ETH** to help cover hosting costs and encourage active participation.
3. **Delegated Staking Model**: Community members can delegate their TEN tokens to node operators, broadening community involvement and fostering a more decentralized ecosystem.

### Performance-Based Rewards

Performance-based rewards are structured to motivate the consistent and high-quality performance of nodes, as follows:

- **Top 10% Performers**: The highest 10% of node operators, ranked by performance and uptime, will earn the top reward bracket. Top performers will receive a reward equivalent to the minimum mainnet staking requirement and will be offered priority access to participate in the mainnet launch.
- **Remaining Participants**: Node operators outside the top 10% but in the top 20% will also receive a reward based on their contributions and performance.

### Participation-Based Rewards

Node operators who meet minimum participation requirements but do not rank in the top 20% will still receive a reward. These rewards aim to foster inclusivity and recognize the contributions of all node operators.

## Testnet Phases & Participation

The incentivized testnet is split into three phases, each lasting approximately **6-8 weeks**, followed by a short intermission between phases. The phases are designed to test and validate different aspects of the network:

1. **Phase 1**: Focus on onboarding developers and user quests aimed at network resilience.
2. **Phase 2**: Dedicated to expanding node operations and enhancing network decentralization.
3. **Phase 3**: Final phase with an emphasis on testing newly deployed dApps and security-focused initiatives.

### Eligibility

- **Application**: Node operators can apply via the [Validator Application Form](https://cform.coinlist.co/forms/56274a78-8291-4899-bee1-a68ecbc5b2b8).
- **Selection**: Applications are prioritized based on node management experience and community commitment, with selected participants notified by email.

  \* Jurisdictional Limitations will be applied.

## Additional Information

- **Updates and Notifications**: Important updates will be shared via the **TEN Discord testnet channel** and by email for selected participants.
- **Documentation**: Technical documents and guides are available on TEN’s official documentation site, with more added throughout the testnet phases.

### Reward Distribution

All rewards will be distributed after the mainnet launch, following the tokenomics vesting schedule outlined in the official TEN whitepaper.

This Node Rewards program aims to build a community-driven network powered by participants' shared efforts and contributions. By rewarding commitment and performance, TEN is cultivating a stable, high-performance Layer 2 ecosystem that is decentralized, secure, and inclusive.
