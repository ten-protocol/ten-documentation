# Running a node

Thank you for your interest in running a node on TEN!

Currently, the capability to run individual nodes is not available publicly. However, we're actively working on this feature and will be launching it soon.

If you are interested in running a TEN validator - use [the form on Coinlist](https://coinlist.co/ten-testnet) to submit your application. 

The deadline to apply is set for 1 March 2024.
