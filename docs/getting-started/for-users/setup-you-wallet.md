# Set up your wallet

TEN is fully compatible with Ethereum and seamlessly integrates with MetaMask. If you're unfamiliar with MetaMask or wallets, start here.

To engage with TEN:

1. [Install](https://metamask.io/download/) MetaMask as a browser extension or mobile app.
2. To use TEN, you have to configure the wallet using the TEN Gateway. Go to the [TEN Gateway](https://gateway.ten.xyz/) for wallet setup, click 'Connect to TEN Testnet', and follow the setup steps. Know more about the TEN Gateway [here](/docs/tools-infrastructure/hosted-gateway.md).

No matter your activity on TEN, you'll probably need tokens to make transactions. See our following section: [Getting tokens.](/docs/getting-started/for-users/get-tokens.md)

## Facing a problem with configuring MetaMask?[​](#facing-a-problem-with-configuring-metamask "Direct link to Facing a problem with configuring MetaMask?")

When using a dApp on TEN, start by checking its documentation and resources. If that doesn't help, consult the TEN docs' [troubleshooting](/docs/category/troubleshooting.md) section or seek assistance on the TEN [Discord](http://discord.gg/yQfmKeNzNd). If the issue appears to be with MetaMask, head to MetaMask's [Help Center](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us) to browse their forums or engage with their Support team.

## Other wallets[​](#other-wallets "Direct link to Other wallets")

TEN currently supports MetaMask and will soon extend compatibility to all EVM-based wallets.
