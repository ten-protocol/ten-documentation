# Set up your wallet

Obscuro is fully compatible with Ethereum and seamlessly integrates with MetaMask. If you're unfamiliar with MetaMask or wallets, start here.

To engage with Obscuro:

1. [Install](https://metamask.io/download/) MetaMask as a browser extension or mobile app.
2. When setting up Obscuro, choose a wallet configuration method:
   - **A. Your dApp:** If the dApp has already integrated with Obscuro, the Gateway Widget will be available. Otherwise, consider option B. More on the Obscuro Gateway Widget [here](/docs/tools-infrastructure/gateway-widget).
   - **B. Hosted Gateway:** Go to the [Obscuro hosted gateway](https://testnet.obscu.ro/) for wallet setup, click 'Join', and follow the setup steps. Know more about the Obscuro Gateway [here](/docs/tools-infrastructure/hosted-gateway).

No matter your activity on Obscuro, you'll probably need tokens to make transactions. See our following section: [Getting tokens.](/docs/getting-started/for-users/get-tokens)

## Facing a problem with configuring Metamask?
When using a dapp on Obscuro, start by checking its documentation and resources. If that doesn't help, consult the Obscuro docs' [troubleshooting](/docs/category/troubleshooting) section or seek assistance on the Obscuro [Discord](http://discord.gg/hbbfThQHT3). If the issue appears to be with MetaMask, head to MetaMask's [Help Center](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us) to browse their forums or engage with their Support team.

## Other wallets

Obscuro currently supports MetaMask and will soon extend compatibility to all EVM-based wallets.
