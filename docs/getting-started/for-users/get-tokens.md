# Get Tokens

## Use Obscuro Discord Faucet

To obtain Obscuro ETH directly on the Obscuro testnet, utilize the Discord faucet. Remember, ENS names won't work; use your actual address. Follow these steps:

1. Join the Obscuro [Discord server](http://discord.gg/hbbfThQHT3).
2. Go to the `#faucet-requests` channel under the `development` category.
3. Enter `/faucet` and select the command.
4. Input your wallet address and hit enter.
5. Your wallet should receive ETH shortly.

If your wallet balance remains unchanged, double-check your wallet configuration or refer to the [set up your wallet](/docs/getting-started/for-users/setup-you-wallet) page.
