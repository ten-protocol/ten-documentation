# Getting started with testnet for users

## Galxe
The main source of activities to participate as a user in testnet are on [Galxe](https://galxe.com/ten)

To fully engage with the Ten testnet, you'll need:
- MetaMask installed
- Setup MetaMask to use Ten testnet
- Testnet tokens

Once you've installed MetaMask, follow the instructions below.

## Setup MetaMask with Ten
- Visit the [Ten Gateway](https://testnet.obscu.ro) and follow the instructions. This will add the Ten testnet as a new network in MetaMask and create an authentication token.

## Use Obscuro Discord Faucet
To obtain Obscuro ETH directly on the Obscuro testnet, utilize the Discord faucet. ENS names won't work; use your actual address. Follow these steps:

1. Join the Obscuro [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HSPwgH89YK).
2. Go to the `#faucet-requests` channel under the `TESTNET INFO` category.
3. Enter `/faucet` and select the command.
4. Input your wallet address and hit enter.
5. Your wallet should receive ETH shortly.

If your wallet balance remains unchanged, double-check your wallet configuration or refer to the [set up your wallet](/docs/getting-started/for-users/setup-you-wallet) page.

You're now fully setup to participate. Begin on [Galxe](https://galxe.com/ten)
