# Testnet FAQ

## What is the Ten testnet?
Ten is a Layer 2 built on Ethereum. Before we can go to mainnet, we need to ensure we’ve tested as thoroughly as possible several key areas of the platform. 

This includes:
-	Developer tooling and the developer experience
-	User experience and tooling, including wallets and bridges
-	Decentralization at scale, including node operation
-	Security and scalability
-	Rewards and incentives

The Ten testnet is a version of Ten that rolls up to the Ethereum Sepolia testnet as opposed to Ethereum mainnet. 

To encourage participation at sufficiently high levels, the testnet is incentivised for developers, users and node operators.

## Who is eligible? 
There are no limits to the number of users. However, developers and node operators will have to go through an application process to ensure suitability. Application decision responses will be sent via email. 

You can apply to be a developer [here](https://ten-testnet.deform.cc/developers) and in later phases, you'll be able to apply to be a node operator.

Eligibility for the Ten testnet is detailed in the “Who May Use the Services” section of the Terms and Conditions. Participation is restricted to jurisdictions where it is permitted by applicable law. To be eligible for rewards, participants must undergo KYC, KYB, and AML checks. 

## When is the deadline to participate?
Users can join at any time prior to the end of the incentivized testnet program. Developers and node operators should apply before January 1st 2024.

## What are the required activities? 
### Users
Users will receive points based on activities carried out on Galxe. These are based on both performance and participation.

### Developers
Developers will receive points based on the dApps they deploy to testnet. You must apply to be a developer and accepted in order to participate. There is a list of suggested dApps to build here.

### Node operators
Node runners will receive points based on the following parameters:
•	Uptime
•	Query execution performance
•	Community engagement

## What are the rewards? 
Rewards are in the form of TEN tokens. They will be rewarded based on the amount of points you have collected as a percentage of the total points. The total amount of tokens allocated to incentivized community contributions is 2.25% of the total token supply.
