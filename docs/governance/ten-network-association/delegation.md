# Token Delegates and Delegating

When you get involved in the governance of TEN, you can either vote directly on proposals or hand over your voting power to a delegate. The delegation system allows $TEN token holders to take part passively by transferring their voting power to delegates who share their values and who they trust to vote on their behalf in a way which aligns to those values. This page breaks down what delegates do and how delegation works within the governance of TEN.

## What is a delegate?[​](#what-is-a-delegate "Direct link to What is a delegate?")

A delegate is someone in the TEN community chosen to represent other token holders and vote on their behalf. They are selected by token holders who decide to give their voting power to them. Delegates must stick to the rules set by TEN Network Association and act in the best interest of the token holders they represent.

## Why delegate?[​](#why-delegate "Direct link to Why delegate?")

Delegation is useful because it allows token holders to be part of the governance of TEN without having to follow every single proposal and vote. By delegating, token holders can let a representative vote on proposals in a way that matches their own views and values.

If you delegate your voting power, you can take it back whenever you want. You might want to do this if there's a proposal you feel strongly about and want to vote on directly.
