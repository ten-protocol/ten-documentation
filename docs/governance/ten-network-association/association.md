# About the TEN Network Association

## Introduction and Vision[​](#introduction-and-vision "Direct link to Introduction and Vision")

### Mission Statement[​](#mission-statement "Direct link to Mission Statement")

The TEN Network Association, the Association, aims to push forward the growth and development of the open-source TEN Network software protocol, building a lively and engaged community around it.

### Purpose[​](#purpose "Direct link to Purpose")

The Association is a not-for-profit organization based in Switzerland, dedicated to promoting, developing, and supporting the TEN software protocol and its ecosystem. The Association’s goal is to tackle challenges within the Web3 space through decentralized governance and community-driven projects.

## Governance and Structure[​](#governance-and-structure "Direct link to Governance and Structure")

### Legal Framework[​](#legal-framework "Direct link to Legal Framework")

The Association operates as a Swiss Association governed by Swiss law. The legal foundation includes the Articles of Association, General Assembly Regulations, Organizational Regulations, and Governance Regulations.

### Organizational Structure[​](#organizational-structure "Direct link to Organizational Structure")

There are a number of bodies within the Association. New bodies can be created over time.

1. **TEN Governance, or DAO**: participants in the TEN ecosystem who submit proposals for the advancement of TEN.
2. **General Assembly**: the top decision-making body made up of all members.
3. **Board**: manages and oversees the Association's operations.
4. **Subcommittees**: created to handle specific tasks and projects, for example, the administration of grant programs.

### Decision-Making Process[​](#decision-making-process "Direct link to Decision-Making Process")

Decisions are made through a combination of General Assembly votes and decentralized governance mechanisms using TEN tokens. Each token gives you one vote, and you can delegate your voting rights. You also need to hold the TEN tokens for at least 30 days. This prevents flash loan attacks. Responsible progress of TEN’s evolution is essential to its long term health and well being. If a proposal is voted in by the DAO but it would be bad for the mission of the TEN Network Association or if a law or regulation would be broken then the Board can step in to assist.
