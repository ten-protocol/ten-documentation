### architecture


#### consensus

TEN combines Ethereum's L1 security, rollup efficiency, Secure Enclave privacy, and the POBI mechanism for a unique consensus approach.

- [Consensus Mechanism](/docs/architecture/consensus.md): TEN combines Ethereum's L1 security, rollup efficiency, Secure Enclave privacy, and the POBI mechanism for a unique consensus approach.

#### design

TEN is architected as an L2 protocol, leveraging the rollup pattern to store transaction data on the L1 chain. While most rollup implementations aim for scalability, TEN's primary objective is confidentiality. The rollups encapsulate the entire encrypted transaction data.

#### interaction-with-ethereum

TEN serves as a confidential extension to Ethereum, enabling assets to move seamlessly between the two networks. While many sidechains and L2 solutions have developed bridges to address mismatches between different network models, TEN's approach is distinct, ensuring a decentralized and secure interaction.

### getting-started


#### for-developers

- [Develop & Deploy dApp](/docs/getting-started/for-developers/develop-deploy-dapp.md): 1. Develop Smart Contracts
- [Explore Contracts in TEN](/docs/getting-started/for-developers/explore-contracts-in-ten.md): TEN offers a distinct environment for smart contract development so you'll need to consider how to design your dApps slightly differently from how you would a transparent dApp. This guide explains these differences:
- [Set Up Dev Environment](/docs/getting-started/for-developers/setup-dev-env.md): 1. Wallet Setup & Configuration

#### for-validators

- [Node Architecture](/docs/getting-started/for-validators/node-architecture.md): SGX Enclave and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- [Node Overview](/docs/getting-started/for-validators/overview.md): Running a node on the TEN network involves participating in the network’s transaction processing, batching, and roll-up mechanisms. As a node operator, you will play a critical role in maintaining the network’s security, scalability, and efficiency. Understanding the flow of transactions and the mechanics of batches and roll-ups is essential for effectively running a node and contributing to the network’s operation.
- [Node Rewards](/docs/getting-started/for-validators/rewards.md): As a node operator, your participation is essential in maintaining a secure, reliable, and high-performance network. In recognition of your contributions, TEN has implemented a comprehensive reward structure to incentivize active and consistent engagement in the network’s testnet phases.
- [Running a TEN Validator Node on Azure](/docs/getting-started/for-validators/running-a-node.md): This guide provides detailed instructions to set up and manage a TEN Validator Node on Azure using Terraform and Ansible. Due to TEN’s use of SGX architecture and cloud-specific security assurances, all current deployments are limited to cloud infrastructure to mitigate risks associated with physical attacks. A proof-of-cloud assertion, provided by TEN, certifies the security and reliability of each validator node running in the cloud.

### governance


#### ten-mica-whitepaper

- [TEN MiCA Whitepaper](/docs/governance/ten-mica-whitepaper/mica-whitepaper-intro.md): Under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) (EU 2023/1114), all crypto-assets offered to the public or admitted to trading must have a corresponding Whitepaper. These documents outline key details such as asset features, risks, rights, and the underlying technology.

#### ten-network-association

- [About the TEN Network Association](/docs/governance/ten-network-association/association.md): Introduction and Vision
- [Token Delegates and Delegating](/docs/governance/ten-network-association/delegation.md): When you get involved in the governance of TEN, you can either vote directly on proposals or hand over your voting power to a delegate. The delegation system allows $TEN token holders to take part passively by transferring their voting power to delegates who share their values and who they trust to vote on their behalf in a way which aligns to those values. This page breaks down what delegates do and how delegation works within the governance of TEN.
- [Overview of the TEN Token](/docs/governance/ten-network-association/ten-token.md): The TEN token, known as $TEN, is an ERC-20 governance token that lets you take part in the TEN’s on-chain decision-making process. The token is created by a smart contract on Ethereum, which is a secure and reliable decentralized blockchain.
- [TEN Improvement Proposals (TIP)](/docs/governance/ten-network-association/tip.md): A TEN Improvement Proposal (TIP) is an essential component of the governance of TEN because it is how participants in the TEN community can have an active role in the evolution of TEN.

#### technology

At the heart of TEN's innovative approach to blockchain encryption lies the pragmatic use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These TEEs are not just about encryption; they ensure unparalleled confidentiality while providing absolute certainty about the code in execution. This technology empowers TEN to deliver a unique blend of smart contracts, decentralization, scalability, and encryption, setting a new benchmark in the blockchain realm.
