### governance


#### governance

TEN's governance framework defines how TEN evolves over time so it can adapt to a changing world while remaining aligned to how TEN is best put to use. It exists to give the TEN community a transparent and accountable way to propose, debate, and decide on changes. While governance is the framework by which changes are proposed and decided upon, how these changes are implemented in practice depends on where control is applied. TEN incorporates a set of technical and economic controls which operate alongside the governance framework. In some cases, these controls may prevent the implementation of approved proposals.

- [Token Delegates and Delegating](/docs/governance/ten-network-association/delegation.md): When you get involved in the governance of TEN, you can either vote directly on proposals or hand over your voting power to a delegate. The delegation system allows $TEN token holders to take part passively by transferring their voting power to delegates who share their values and who they trust to vote on their behalf in a way which aligns to those values. This page breaks down what delegates do and how delegation works within the governance of TEN.
- [Overview of the TEN Token](/docs/governance/ten-network-association/ten-token.md): The TEN token, known as $TEN, is an ERC-20 governance token that lets you take part in the TEN’s on-chain decision-making process. The token is created by a smart contract on Ethereum, which is a secure and reliable decentralized blockchain.
- [TEN Improvement Proposals (TIP)](/docs/governance/ten-network-association/tip.md): A TEN Improvement Proposal (TIP) is an essential component of the governance of TEN because it is how participants in the TEN community can have an active role in the evolution of TEN.

#### introduction

TEN is a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 rollup protocol that introduces data confidentiality, computational privacy, and resistance to Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) by leveraging hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEN represents a major step forward in decentralized system design by reintroducing data access controls — a foundational feature of Web2 that Web3 largely abandoned in favor of radical transparency.

#### overview

Running a node on the TEN network involves participating in the network’s transaction processing, batching, and roll-up mechanisms. As a node operator, you will play a critical role in maintaining the network’s security, scalability, and efficiency. Understanding the flow of transactions and the mechanics of batches and roll-ups is essential for effectively running a node and contributing to the network’s operation.

#### rewards

As a node operator, your participation is essential in maintaining a secure, reliable, and high-performance network. In recognition of your contributions, TEN has implemented a comprehensive reward structure to incentivize active and consistent engagement in the network’s testnet phases.

#### running-a-node

This guide provides detailed instructions to set up and manage a TEN Validator Node on Azure using Terraform and Ansible. Due to TEN’s use of SGX architecture and cloud-specific security assurances, all current deployments are limited to cloud infrastructure to mitigate risks associated with physical attacks. A proof-of-cloud assertion, provided by TEN, certifies the security and reliability of each validator node running in the cloud.
